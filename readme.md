## FAQs

**Why?**

No good reason.

**Can i use it in production?**

Sure, if you don't mind production crashing every 2 days. I'm kidding, this is currently in beta and I wouldn't recommend doing anything right now. Other than maybe use it in side projects and report issues that you might find.

**Doesn't this library already exist?**

Yep, most of the utils you'll find here already exist somewhere on NPM and I'm just writing them to feel good about having my own set of utilties.
More like how bad would they be if I wrote them.

**Can you add _xyz_?**

Yeah, no. (\*)

(\*) You can contribute any utility that you might wish to add into the package. I work on multiple things at any given time so it's going to be faster if you can add one yourself.
